### :joystick: How to setup storybook locally

- Install all essential prerequisites before launching the Storybook environment locally. To install the dependencies, run the command below:

  ```cmd
  npm install
  ```

- Now that you've installed all of the `node modules` in your project, you can launch the Storybook environment. To get started, type the command below:

  ```cmd
  npm run storybook
  ```

- By default, this will launch your local Storybook environment on port `6006`.
