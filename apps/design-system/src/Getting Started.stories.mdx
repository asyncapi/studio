## Welcome

Welcome to Atoms, the [Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com) design system. Here you'll find useful information about how to design UI components for Studio as well as a bunch of ready-made components.

## Philosophy

This design system is based on the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/). In the components section on the sidebar, you'll be able to find all the components or "atoms".

We strive for keeping a well-organized catalog of components that yo can reuse and are **decoupled from the Studio business logic**.
Therefore, we highly encourage you to work on your UI components in this project instead of in the Studio one. Even if they're not going to make it to the design system.

## Contribute

This design system is open-source and available at https://github.com/asyncapi/studio/tree/master/apps/design-system. Join us to improve it!
